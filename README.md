# Survuval-prediction-in-Titanic
In this model we'll be trying to predict a classification- survival or deceased based on the titanic data set from kaggle.In this project I have used the scikit learn library to predict he survival of a passenger based on different features like age, class, gender etc. I have used Logistic regression for this model for classification.
